## AI Prompts Used


1. I want to build something around decision-making. 
Maybe like a skincare recommendation system? 
Users input skin type and concerns, and it suggests products.
How do I structure something like that logically?


2. Okay this skincare idea is getting complicated.
Even oily skin has acne, sensitivity, hormonal stuff… 
It’s becoming too subjective.Can you suggest decision problems where the inputs are measurable and numeric? Something I can actually score properly?


3. What if I build something for placements? Like a strategy generator based on
 Days left, company type, role, skill level etc can this be turned into a weighted logic system
 

4. I want to score offers on:
 CTC, growth potential, work life balance ,layoff rate ,bond duration,location preferance
How do I normalize mixed numeric and rating values? And what weights make sense?


5. My CSS and JS are in the static folder but not loading. Getting 404.How exactly should I reference static files in Flask templates?


6. Build the OfferIQ UI layout
Left Chat assistant panel
Right Offer input form
Below Ranked results
Make it structured and professional.


7. i want the offeriq page to look like an AI chat interface. on the left
side a chatbot called OfferIQ narrates the analysis as the user adds
offers. on the right side there is a form to enter offer details and
below that the ranked results show up. can you build this layout
with proper styling?


8. right now when i click the button it adds and scores the offer at the
same time. but the problem is if i add offers one by one the ctc
normalization recalculates each time and the scores keep changing.
can i separate it into two buttons — one to just add the offer to a
queue and another button called analyze all that only appears after
at least one offer is added and scores everything together at once?


9. right now my code was only comparing two offers. i want it to work for
any number of offers — like 3, 5, 10. the normalization should compare
all of them together at the same time. how do i change the code to
support a dynamic list instead of just two fixed offers?


10. my css and js files are not loading. i put them in a folder called
static but the browser is showing 404 errors. in my html i wrote
href="styles.css" but it doesnt work. how do i link static files
correctly in flask?


11. I’m getting 500 error when generating strategy.
Help me debug Route existence JSON mismatch KeyErrors Frontend-backend integration issues


12. How do I convert OfferIQ into a full Career Companion System?
Not just offer comparison.
More like Placement strategy ,Application tracking, Daily planner ,Interview prep ,Resume assistant


13. i want to build a placement strategy generator. the user fills in
how many days are left, what tier of company they are targeting
like faang or service or startup, their role like sde or ml engineer,
and their current skill levels for dsa system design communication
and resume on a scale of 1 to 5. based on all this it should generate
a personalized study roadmap. how do i approach this?


14. i want to show the user how ready they are for placement as a percentage.
it should be based on their 1-5 ratings for dsa sd communication and
resume. but the weights of each skill should depend on the role —
for consulting communication matters more than dsa, for sde its
the opposite. how do i implement this weighted readiness score?


15. right now all the placement engine logic is written in javascript
inside placement.js. i want to move all the calculation logic to
python and just call it from javascript using fetch. how do i convert
the javascript functions to python flask routes? and what should the
request and response json look like for each route?


16. i want to separate the placement python code into different files
instead of putting everything in one big file. like one file for
building the roadmap, one for calculating readiness, one for risk,
one for daily tasks, one for tracking applications. how do i structure
this as a python package and import from one file into another?


17. can you go through the decision engine and the placement engine code
and tell me what edge cases can break them? like what happens if only
one offer is added, what if someone has 5 days left and is targeting
faang, what if all ctc values are the same. give me the exact inputs
and what the expected output should be. also check if the task lists
for each phase are fully written or if there are any gaps


18. How can I verify whether the frontend, Flask backend, and decision engine are correctly integrated?


19. Can I use a database only for the Application Tracker module and daily planner?


20. can i use session memory to store the daily planner data so that it doesnt disapper for each refresh
